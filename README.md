What is iMorpheus?
----------------
iMorpheus is a public blockchain that serves as a credit rating platform and trust search engine to facilitate trade between accounts in the world of blockchains.
We use a universal account system with which users can link multiple external accounts together.
Credit scores for every account can be calculated by credit rating scripts (CRS) on iMorpheus.
Upon requests, our miners execute CRS, update and store credit scores, and generate blocks via consensus based on proof of work.
Based on our credit score, accounts from different blockchains, and human users behind them, will trade more efficiently and with more confidence.
